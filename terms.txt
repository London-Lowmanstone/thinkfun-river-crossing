Here is a file with the terms used in the documentation.
Since Python is often not typed, sometimes it is helpful to know the form of particular terms.
The term "usually" means that it's almost always this way, but that the program isn't dependent on it.

board:
    form:
        Board object
    description:
        The model of a River Crossing puzzle in-progress.
        Keeps track of what pegs and planks are on the board, what plank is being carried, where the person is, and where the finish is.

direction:
    form:
        integer
        Usually in the range [0, 3] (inclusive)
    description:
        0: up
        1: right
        2: down
        3: left

        Signifies a direction.

distance:
    form:
        integer
    description:
        The distance between two pegs is the Manhattan distance between them if they are in the same row or column.
        If they are not in the same row or column, the distance between them is undefined.
        This is because planks and walk moves only occur within the same row or column.

held plank:
    form:
        integer
        Usually in the range [1, 3] (inclusive).
    description:
        A held plank is only good for placing, and the only thing we care about when placing is the plank's length.
        Therefore, a held plank is merely the length of the plank that was grabbed
        Planks in River Crossing only have a maximum length of 3, thus the range.

letter:
    form:
        string
        Usually a character or number
    description:
        River Crossing solution strings contain many letters

move:
    form:
        (move type, peg)
    description:
        There are three things you can do in River Crossing:
            Walk somewhere
            Grab a plank
            Place a plank

        If the move is a walk move, executing the move should have the person move to the peg.
        If the move is a grab move, executing the move should have the person pick up the plank between them and the peg.
        If the move is a place move, executing the move should have the person place their held plank between themselves and the peg.

move type:
    form:
        string
        Either 'walk' or 'grab' or 'place'.

peg:
    form:
        integer
        Usually in the range [1, 35] (inclusive).
    description:
        A slot on the board.
        The pegs are labeled left-to-right, top-to-bottom (like you're reading) starting at 1.
        This means the top-left is 1, the top-right is 5, the the bottom-left is 31, and the bottom-right is 35.

plank:
    form:
        (peg1, peg2)
        where peg1 and peg2 are pegs, and peg1 < peg2.
    description:
        A plank between two pegs.

puzzle:
    form:
        Board object
    description:
        Puzzles used to be different than Boards, but now they're the same, and they're all called Boards.
        It didn't really make sense to have a separate Puzzle class just for one `finish` property that could just be set to `None` on a board.

RC:
    description:
        Short for "River Crossing"

RC character:
    description:
        River Crossing solution character

River Crossing solution character:
    form:
        string
        len == 1
    description:
        A character from a River Crossing solution string.
        These may be number strings as well, since the solutions also use numbers.
        (For example, '3' is a number string.)

River Crossing solution string:
    form:
        string
        Usually in the exact format of the solutions given in the River Crossing booklet.
        For example: 'UX-IX GI-GQ GQ-4Q QR-34'

    description:
        How the game itself gives solutions.
        Usually you need a translator dictionary to convert between their numbers and letters and the peg numbers,
        ...if you want to convert a solution given by this code into a solution that looks like this.

solution:
    form:
        list of moves
    description:
        This is a list of moves that will solve a puzzle.

translator:
    form:
        dictionary
        Either {River Crossing solution character: peg} or {peg: River Crossing solution character}
    description:
        Dictionary that converts pegs into River Crossing solution characters or vice versa.
